# Clustering time series data with SQL
Clustering time series data with SQL.

See the analysis code in [sql-clustering](sql-clustering.ipynb) notebook.

Examples in this repository might be helpful, if you must use `SQL` instead of proper data science tools such as `python`. Thus this repository is not a comprehensive guide for time series data clustering.

Even though clustering is often connected to machine learning, this showcase relies only on logical decision making.

I have focused on IoT related data in the field of predictive maintenance.
