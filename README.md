# Clustering time series data with SQL

## Description
Clustering time series data with SQL. The purpose is to prove that doing data science doesn't always require fancy tools.

Examples in this repository might be helpful, if you must use `SQL` instead of proper data science tools such as `python`. Thus this repository is not a comprehensive guide for time series data clustering.

Even though clustering is often connected to machine learning, this showcase relies only on logical decision making.

I have focused on IoT related data in the field of predictive maintenance.
